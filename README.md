# Project Management as Code
> _Using [graphviz] and [`git`] to perform project management tasks._

I have studied [Graph Theory][graphs] back in college but I never really used
it in a project or something serious in general.

However, I recently have read a nice [article] by [@ianmiell] illustrating how he
used graphs with his engeneering team to manage tasks for a relatively large
project in a large enterprise covering a wide variety of use cases and demands

[Here's the article][article].

In this repo, I apply that to a much larger life-changing project:
_Obtaining a driver's license_ :wink:.
(It's not complete .. just enough to play with the [dot language][dot] a little).
